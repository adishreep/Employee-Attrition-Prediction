# Employee Attrition Prediction

Problem Statement- High employee attrition rates can be detrimental to a company's productivity, morale, and financial stability. To address this, exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify patterns and trends in employee data, uncover significant factors leading to attrition, and enable the company to implement measures to retain employees and decrease attrition rates.

Outcome- From exploratory data analysis, several insights were drawn. Younger employees, those with lower salaries and fewer promotions, and those who traveled frequently were more likely to leave. Dissatisfied employees with low levels of engagement and commitment were also more likely to leave the organization.
